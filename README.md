## Problem Statement :
In the realm of online education and entertainment, there is a growing demand for engaging and informative platforms that facilitate learning and entertainment simultaneously. However, existing online quiz platforms often suffer from various shortcomings, hindering the overall user experience and educational value they provide.

Key issues faced by current online quiz platforms include:

Lack of Interactivity: Many online quiz platforms offer static questions and answers without engaging interactive elements, resulting in a passive learning experience for users.

Limited Content Variety: Some platforms have a narrow range of topics or questions, failing to cater to the diverse interests and knowledge levels of users.

Inadequate Feedback Mechanisms: Feedback on quiz performance is often minimal or absent, preventing users from understanding their strengths and weaknesses and inhibiting their learning progress.

Technical Issues: Technical glitches, such as slow loading times, crashes, or compatibility issues with different devices, disrupt the user experience and discourage participation.

Accessibility Challenges: Some platforms may not be accessible to users with disabilities or those using assistive technologies, excluding a significant portion of the potential audience.
